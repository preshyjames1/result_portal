## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/rehoboth-portal.git
cd rehoboth-portal
npm install
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

### 2. Set up Supabase

1. Create a new Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Run the full schema in **SQL Editor**:
   ```
   Copy and paste the contents of schema.sql
   ```
3. Create the storage bucket:
   - Go to **Storage** → **New Bucket**
   - Name: `results`
   - Uncheck "Public bucket" (must be **private**)
4. Copy your project URL and keys to `.env.local`

### 3. Set up Paystack

1. Create a [Paystack](https://paystack.com) account
2. Get your **Public Key** and **Secret Key** from the dashboard
3. Set up a webhook endpoint:
   - URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/payment/webhook`
   - Events: `charge.success`
4. Copy the webhook secret to `.env.local`

### 4. Set up Resend (Email)

1. Create a [Resend](https://resend.com) account
2. Verify your sending domain (e.g. `rehobothcollege.edu.ng`)
3. Create an API key and add to `.env.local`

### 5. Create first admin

```bash
# Add ADMIN_EMAIL and ADMIN_PASSWORD to .env.local (plain text password)
npm run setup-admin
```

This creates the admin in the database and prints the password hash. You can then remove `ADMIN_PASSWORD` from `.env.local` and keep only `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`.

### 6. Generate session secret

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
# Add to SESSION_SECRET in .env.local
```

### 7. Run locally

```bash
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

---

## Deploy to Vercel

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel

# Set environment variables
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
vercel env add SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
# ... (add all vars from .env.local.example)

# Redeploy after setting env vars
vercel --prod
```

### Cron job (auto-publish)

The `vercel.json` includes a cron that runs every minute to auto-publish scheduled results.
You must set `CRON_SECRET` in your Vercel environment. Vercel will send this as the
`x-cron-secret` header (or you can use Vercel's built-in cron authentication).

## PIN System

### Standard PINs

- Created by admin or auto-generated after Paystack payment
- **Unbound on creation** — `claimed_by_student_id` is NULL
- **Locked to first student** who uses them (permanent, atomic transaction)
- **Usage limit: 5** (configurable)
- Every use logged to `pin_usage` table
- Subject to `is_published` gate — students cannot see unpublished results

### Master Credentials

Master credentials are a **pair**: `master_number` + `pin_code`.

| Feature | Standard PIN | Master Credential |
|---|---|---|
| Purchasable | ✅ Yes (Paystack) | ❌ No (admin only) |
| Student-locked | ✅ After first use | ❌ Never |
| Scope | One student | All students OR one specific |
| Bypasses publish gate | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Usage log | `pin_usage` | `master_pin_usage` |

**Two scopes:**
- `all` — After auth, admin can look up any student at `/master/browse`
- `student` — After auth, admin is redirected directly to the scoped student's result

**Security:**
- The full PIN is displayed **only once** at creation (shown in a modal with copy button)
- Thereafter, only the masked version (`XXXX-XXXX-****`) is visible in the table
- PINs are stored as **plaintext** in the database (protected by RLS — service role key only)
- All routes require `admin_session` to access the master PIN management API

**Usage counting:**
- `usage_count` is incremented **once per `/api/master/verify` call**, not per student viewed in browse mode
- Each student view in browse mode is logged to `master_pin_usage` for auditing

---

## Scheduled Publishing

Results have three states:

| State | `is_published` | `publish_at` | Student can view |
|---|---|---|---|
| Draft | `false` | `NULL` | ❌ No |
| Scheduled | `false` | `[datetime]` | ❌ Not yet |
| Published | `true` | any | ✅ Yes |

The cron job at `/api/admin/publish/cron` runs every minute via Vercel Crons and publishes any results whose `publish_at <= now()`.

Master credentials bypass the publish gate entirely.

---

## Security Design

- All DB access uses `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` server-side only (never exposed to client)
- RLS enabled on all tables with `USING (false)` — only service role can query
- All result access gated by signed JWT cookies (HTTP-only, Secure, SameSite=Strict)
- Signed URLs expire in **120 seconds**; page refreshes them every 90 seconds
- Paystack webhook verified via **HMAC SHA512**
- Cron endpoint protected by `CRON_SECRET` header
- Rate limiting on `/api/verify` and `/api/master/verify`: 5 requests/minute per IP
- Standard PIN claim is done with an **optimistic lock** to prevent race conditions
- IP address logged on every PIN use
- `/master` page is not linked from the public navigation (security by obscurity + session gating)
- `Cache-Control: no-store` on all result-related responses

---

## Bulk Upload Format

Upload a ZIP file where each PDF is named `{ADMISSION_NO}.pdf`:

```
results-2024.zip
├── RC-2024-001.pdf
├── RC-2024-002.pdf
└── RC-2024-003.pdf
```

The system:
1. Extracts each PDF in memory (no temp files)
2. Matches by admission number (case-insensitive)
3. Uploads to Supabase Storage at `/{session}/{class}/{student_id}.pdf`
4. Upserts the `results` row
5. Returns a detailed report

Max ZIP size is controlled by `MAX_BULK_ZIP_SIZE_MB` (default: 50MB).
